# Python Web Scraping Project 2: Data Collection & Automation with Selenium and Pandas (Bangla)

Project Overview:
This repository contains my second Python web scraping project, where I demonstrate how to automate data collection from a live website using Selenium. In this project, I collected detailed product information, including names, IDs, prices, stock availability, and descriptions, and stored the data in an Excel file for easy analysis. This project is aimed at both beginners and intermediate Python users who want to enhance their web scraping and data automation skills.
